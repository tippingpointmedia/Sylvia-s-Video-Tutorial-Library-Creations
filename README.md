### Sylvia's Video-Tutorial Library Creations
Coding video tutorials that I have created for beginners <br>

This is a library database containing all the scripts that I refer to in my video tutorials. As a developer, I have realized that one of the best ways to learn anything is to teach others. This "learn, do, learn, teach" approach is what helps me grow as a web developer, and in turn, helps others as well. It's a win-win situation and that's what motivates me to keep creating tutorials. It also allows me to practice my communication skills more when breaking down complex concepts into simple steps and explaining it verbally.
