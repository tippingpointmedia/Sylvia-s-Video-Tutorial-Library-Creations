This is a library containing all the scripts that I refer to in my video tutorials, as well as the latest videos released related to web development tutorials. As a developer, I have realized that one of the best ways to learn anything is to teach others. This "learn, do, learn, teach" approach is what helps me grow as a web developer, and in turn, helps others as well. It's a win-win situation and that's what motivates me to keep creating tutorials. It also allows me to practice my communication skills more when breaking down complex concepts into simple steps and explaining it verbally. Feel free to subscribe to my channel on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/SylviaMarketing23) or follow this repo to be updated on new content as I continue on my web developer journey! :)
